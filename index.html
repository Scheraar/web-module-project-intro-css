    <p class="secondparagraph">First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
    waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep
    valleys, grand meadows, ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and
    much more.</p>

    <p>Fire is a natural and essential part of Yosemite. We manage fire carefully and study
    how it interacts with the park’s ecosystems. This blog provides updates
    about fires in Yosemite. Check for current fire restrictions.</p>
   <img src= "https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/820/820374.svg" alt ="van"> <p>We strongly recommend
    that you make reservations for lodging, camping, and backpacking. You can
    pay the park entrance fee upon arrival (there's no need to pay it in
    advance).</p>
